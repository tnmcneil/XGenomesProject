# XGenomesProject
This is the repository for our final project for CS 542, working with XGenomes


* CNN_frame_classifier.py corresponds to approach 1 as outlined in the paper
* CNN_whole_img_Train.py corresponds to approach 2 as outlined in the paper
* CNN_slide_window.py corresponds to approach 3 as outlined in the paper
* CNN_molecule_classifier.py corresponds to approach 4 as outlined in the paper

* CNN_Test.py can be used to load and test a model generated by the models from approaches 2 or 3

* DNA_Recognizer_Trainer.py and DNA_Image_Cropper.py correspond to the RetinaNet model trained to extract individual molecules from the aggregate images to be used for approach 4 
* binding_simulator.py generates the simulated data based on binding location from NEBcutter to be used for approach 2
* slide_window.py generates the sub images by sliding a uniform window along the aggregate image to be used for approach 3
